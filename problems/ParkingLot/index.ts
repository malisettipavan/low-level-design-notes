// Problem Statement
// 1) We own a parking lot that can hold upto 'N' cars at any given point of time
// 2) Each slot is given a Number starting from 1 increasing with increasing distance from the entry point in steps of one.
// 3) We want to create an automated ticketing System that allows my customers to use my parking lot without human intervention.

// 4) When a cars enters the parking lot,
//    => we need to issue a ticket to driver
//    => The ticket issuing process includes us documenting the registration number(number plate), color of the car and allocate a 
//       available parking slot to the car before actually handing over a ticket to the driver.
//    => It is recommended to allocate a parking lot which is nearer to the entrance.

// 5) At the exit, the customer returns the ticket which then marks the slot as Available.

// 6) Due to Government Regulation, the system should provide me with the ability to find out
//    => Registration numbers of all cars of a particular color
//    => Slot number in which a car with given registration number is parked.
//    => Slot numbers of all slots where a car of a particular car is parked.
